        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Risotto is an Italian rice dish cooked with broth and wine until the rice reaches a creamy consistency.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 shallots</li>
            <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
            <li>9 dl of mushroom broth</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>3 dl of carnaroli or arborio</li>
            <li>2 dl of white wine</li>
            <li>250 g of mushroom (portobello or chanterelle)</li>
            <li>3 tbs of butter</li>
            <li>2 dl of parmesan, shredded</li>
            <li>salt, pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and finely chop the shallots and garlic.</li>
            <li>Boil the broth and keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Lightly fry the shallots and garlic in olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the rice fry until gleaming.</li>
            <li>Add the wine and let it boil.</li>
            <li>Add 3-4 dl of broth to the rice and simmer whilst stirring.</li>
            <li>Add 1 dl of broth at a time as the rice absorbs the broth.</li>
            <li>The risotto is ready after about 15-20 min. Taste a few corn rice after consistency.</li>
            <li>Fry the mushroom in butter and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the mushroom to the rice.</li>
            <li>Add 2 dl of parmesan.</li>
            <li>the risotto should be creamy. Add more broth and simmer as necessary.</li>
